    <P>My name is Henry Ije and I am from Lagos, Nigeria. After studying chemical engineering and graduating with a second class upper division. 
        I decided to pursue a career in data analytics and software engineering with the faith that I would get a high paying job and also build a startup. This is one reason why I decided to take up the challenge with Tiidelab. For data analytics, I am familiar with the following tools such as excel, power bi, tableau, sql and python. While for software engineering, I am familiar with html, css and python
    <p>Aside from computer programminng, my hobbies are playing football, chess, listening to music and studying the word of Bible. I play football with my friends and also enjoy watching my favorite club Arsenal. Hopefully we would win the premier league this season if Man city decides not to be stupid. I played a lot of chess while in the university and almost came late for an exam because I was playing chess.My favorite musician is Burna Boy. Yes I also enjoy listening to the word of God. Don't ask me why my favorite musician isn't Don Moen. 
        I love reading books, some of my favorites are "Zero to One by Peter Thiel", "Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe", "Think and Grow Rich y Napoleon Hill".
